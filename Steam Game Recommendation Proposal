Project Idea: Steam game recommendations based on a list of user submitted games.

- User sorts games by rating (5 stars?)
- Program recommends similar games based on rating and genre and whatever else we may decide.
- Possible AI summary describing the recommended game and how it relates to submitted games

Pros:
- Numerous extremely well documented APIs
- A lot of opportunity for help from forums and Discords
- Optional but theoretically easy to implement AI
- Not reinvinting the wheel: no need to invent anything to make it work (something that the professor is against anyway)

Cons:
- Not original (though this could be seen as a good thing)
- Not especially helpful outside of this project

My main concern is being too overambitious and too overconfident in our ability to complete this project in time so whatever we do we have to keep it simple.
